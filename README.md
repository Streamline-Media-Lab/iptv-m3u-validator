# iptv-m3u-validator

Validate any IPTV M3U playlist URL — detect broken/geo-restricted/duplicate streams.

[![CI](https://github.com/Streamline-Media-Lab/iptv-m3u-validator/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Streamline-Media-Lab/iptv-m3u-validator/actions)

## Why this exists

Validate an M3U / M3U8 IPTV playlist URL — detect broken streams, duplicates, geo-restrictions, slow servers. Outputs JSON for CI.

This is part of an open-source toolkit we maintain across [9 sibling
organizations](#sister-organization-tools-sibling-repos-in-the-streaming-research-network)
to support our IPTV testing rig. Editorial work lives at
[StreamReviewHQ](https://streamreviewhq.com/) and our recommended provider
is [IPTVTheOne](https://iptvtheone.com).

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Streamline-Media-Lab/iptv-m3u-validator.git
cd iptv-m3u-validator
# Python 3.10+, stdlib only (no pip install needed)
```

## Usage

```bash
python iptv_m3u_validator.py https://example.com/playlist.m3u --limit 20
```

Run `python iptv_m3u_validator.py --help` for all options.

## How it works

See the docstring at the top of [`iptv_m3u_validator.py`](./iptv_m3u_validator.py) —
the methodology is the same one used in our 90-day provider testing rig.
